We propose a unified motion planning framework for mobile manipulators. It consists of two parts: a sampling-based path planner with feasibility-aware focus regions for efficient path generation, and a WA-QN optimizer that adaptively filters and aggregates curvature information to enhance convergence in high-dimensional spaces.
